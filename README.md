This is a framework for starting activity by url*(“Scheme”)* on Android.

[中文README文档](./README-CN.md)

###Dependencies

Basic config:
```Groovy
// add it to your build.gradle on app project
compile 'org.lzh.nonview.router:router-api:0.3'
```

If you've added *[Parceler](https://github.com/yjfnypeu/Parceler)* into your app, the best practice is to add a Compile-time framework to create route rules with annotations *RouterRule* to make *Parceler* more convenient:

```Groovy
// add it to your build.gradle on app project
apt 'org.lzh.nonview.router:router-compiler:0.3'
```

###Features

* Support all types of *Bundle*  
* Support interceptor, for example, you can config a interceptor to **force request login** before open a activity that requires login.
* Support open with browser when your scheme were **http/https**  
* Support add extras while open an Activity  
* Support set request code and launch mode and animation when open activity by route*  
* Flexible config: You can config your route rules automatically*(by use RouteRule annotation)* or manually
